# FantasyRally Mobile App

Local dev:

1. In `webapp/fantasyrally/mobile-app` run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

2. In `webapp/fantasyrally/server` run the server to enable uploads:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Admin UI is at `/admin` in the app and uses the server at `http://localhost:4000` to list and upload files into `public/content`.
