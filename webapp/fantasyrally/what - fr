Fantasy Rally is the ultimate 2d/3d vehicle customization tool/game. It will be integrated with most - if not all - of the top AI image generation mobile/web apps, with each mobile/web app providing it's own custom twist on the image generation.

The app will ultimately consist - in the beginning - of a js/jsx canvas with customizable sidebars/headers/footers; allowing for the much needed personalized customization interface. Since some users may not like the design capabilities that come stock in the Fantasy Rally menu, they are given the ability to add custom integrations with other AI websites/parts menus that do not orginally come with it.

Another large feature in this app will be the ability for users to edit their own cars, as well as create 3d models of their real-life vehicles. This comes in handy for users who want to see how some parts may look on their cars, before they add them to their shopping cart.

Users can experience a live chat menu in the forefront of the website, where they can vote on the top customizations/edits submitted by other users; either for the week, or for the same day.

Users can earn Fantasy Rally (FR) credits by sharing the app with friends, producing top leaderboard content, or by competing and winning in the sidekick-app: 'Gods Rods'.
